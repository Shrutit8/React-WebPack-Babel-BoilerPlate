# React-WebPack 4-Babel 7-BoilerPlate
Extensible and easy to implement React-Webpack-Babel boilerplate.
There are many boilerplates available for React Webpack which can be complex and difficult to understand for a beginner. So here is my approach on React boilerplate which is minimalistic and which can be extended with little effort. 
It is a light dev environment setup.  :ghost: :+1:
